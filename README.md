Comparative Analysis of Neural Network and Logistic Regression Algorithms for Drug Classification

# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Short Description
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models. The analysis leverages data preprocessing, model evaluation, and improvement strategies to determine the most suitable model for accurate predictions.

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to set up the project environment and reproduce the analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
 
## Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
     cd heart-disease-prediction

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Tests

To execute the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:

jupyter notebook HeartDiseasePrediction.ipynb

## Breakdown of Tests

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between variables.
3. Model Training and Testing: Includes Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, KNN, MLP, and SVM.
4. Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## Results

•Best Model: Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 91.69%.
Insights:
• Mental health issues were slightly more prevalent than physical health issues in the dataset.
• Sleep time and BMI variability indicated opportunities for further research into lifestyle factors and health outcomes.
• Class imbalance required targeted strategies like SMOTE and adjusted class weights.

## Deployment

Currently, the project is designed for local analysis and does not include a deployment component. Future work includes deploying the model via Flask or Django.
